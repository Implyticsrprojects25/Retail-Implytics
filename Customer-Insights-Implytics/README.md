# Customer-Insights-Implytics 🚀

Part of the **Retail-Implytics** portfolio.  
**Implytics mantra:** _Trust · Turn · Transform · Improve_.

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze customer purchase behavior to surface actionable insights for category managers:
- Identify high‑value segments (e.g., RFM: Champions, Loyal, At Risk).
- Drivers of spend and frequency by segment and product family.
- Practical recommendations to increase retention and basket size.

## 📦 Data
Place source files in `data/raw/`. Keep transformed tables in `data/processed/`.
> Tip: avoid committing large/raw data files. Version the processing scripts instead.

## 📐 Metrics & Features (starter)
- **RFM**: Recency, Frequency, Monetary value
- **Basket metrics**: items per basket, AOV, category mix
- **Customer lifecycle**: first/last purchase, tenure, churn proxy
- **Cohorts**: monthly acquisition & retention

## 🗺️ Project Plan (suggested)
1. Data audit & cleaning (`notebooks/01_exploration.Rmd`)
2. Feature engineering (`scripts/02_features.R`)
3. Segmentation & profiling (`scripts/03_segmentation_rfm.R`)
4. Insights & viz (`notebooks/04_insights.Rmd`)
5. Executive summary (`docs/executive-summary.md`)

## 🧪 Environment (reproducible)
Use `renv` to pin package versions.

```r
# one-time setup
source("scripts/01_setup_renv.R")
# later sessions
renv::activate()
```
